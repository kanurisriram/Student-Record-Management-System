## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17 or above recommended)
- Swing (Java GUI)
- AWT
- File-based storage using `.dat` files (no external database or JDBC)
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (IDE)

---

## 📋 Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed and set up on your machine:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 17 or above  
  _Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/)_

- **IDE (Optional but Recommended):** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java-supporting IDE for easier development and execution.

- **Git** (for cloning the repository)  
  _Download and install from [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/)_

## 💾 Data Storage & Persistence

This project uses file-based storage with `.dat` files to persist student data locally. The application reads and writes student records directly to these files, eliminating the need for external database setup or JDBC connectivity. This approach keeps the system lightweight and easy to deploy, while ensuring data persists between sessions.

---
## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management-system.git
   cd student-management-system
   ```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

3. Run the file
     ```Compile and run StudentManagementSystem.java```

---

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Optional)

This project optionally supports MySQL for persistence used by `SRMS.java` and `ForgotPassword.java`.

- Install MySQL and create a database named `srmsdb`.
- Import `MYSQL Local.session.sql` to create the tables.
- Add MySQL Connector/J (mysql-connector-java-x.y.z.jar) to the `lib/` folder and run the app with `lib/` on the classpath.
- Set your MySQL password via an environment variable named `DB_PASSWORD` (recommended) or edit the code.

Example (PowerShell):
```powershell
setx DB_PASSWORD "your_db_password"
javac -cp ".;lib/*" *.java
java -cp ".;lib/*" SRMSLogin
```

If the JDBC driver is missing, the application shows an informative message in the UI.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Integration with a relational database (MySQL, SQLite) using JDBC for scalable data management.
- Implement DAO pattern for cleaner code separation and easier maintenance.
- Enhance UI responsiveness and add more analytics features.
